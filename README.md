Program 2 as in anandvarun/LetsCode

Q) Check if a given number is prime in O(sqrt(n)) time

Logic:

m= sqrt(n)
m * m =a * b
Three cases:
1) a < m and b > m
2)a = m and b = m
3)a > m and b < m

Hence it is enough to check do num % i for numbers ranging from 2 to sqrt(num)

Imports:
java.math.*;
Math.sqrt(num)
